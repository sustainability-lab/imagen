      "prompt": "Create a full scientific poster titled "SentinelKilnDB: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Brick Kiln Detection From Satellite Imagery". Overall style: NeurIPS-style clean vector infographic with strong hierarchy, thin lines, blue-magenta palette, large heading, clear section boxes, icons, maps, and satellite textures. Aspect ratio 16:9 or A0 poster. Avoid clutter; use modern ML-diagram aesthetics. TOP BANNER: • Title + authors box • Hero visual: Sentinel-2 RGB tile containing several circular brick kilns with bounding boxes and masks. • Small India map with red dots marking kiln clusters. SECTION 1 – MOTIVATION: Box titled "Why Brick Kiln Detection?". Include icons for: air pollution, emissions hotspots, compliance monitoring, India's manufacturing base. Text: "Kilns are major contributors to particulate pollution; automated monitoring requires scalable, reliable detection." SECTION 2 – DATASET: Large panel summarizing SentinelKilnDB. • Show satellite tile grid (10m Sentinel-2). • Highlight number of images (~78k), number of annotated kilns (~>100k). • Show variety: different shapes (clamp, FCBTK), colors, seasons. • Three split maps: train / val / test with geographic separation. • Add an inset showing annotation style: oriented bounding boxes vs axis-aligned. SECTION 3 – LABELING PIPELINE: Create a pipeline diagram: Step 1: Sentinel-2 image ingestion. Step 2: Candidate region selection. Step 3: Kiln annotation with OBB masks. Step 4: Quality checks, deduplication, and filtering. Add icons and simple arrows. SECTION 4 – MODEL BENCHMARK: Panel showing the models benchmarked: • Faster R-CNN • YOLOv8 • RT-DETR • Oriented Object Detectors (OBB transformers) Display simple icon-style model blocks + arrows → prediction heatmap. SECTION 5 – CHALLENGES: Three sub-panels: (A) Small object detection at 10m. (B) High background confusion: farms, chimneys, warehouses. (C) Extreme appearance variability across geographies. Visuals: false positives (haystacks, domes), false negatives in hazy scenes. SECTION 6 – RESULTS: A results block with: • mAP table (AA + OBB results). • Kiln-wise precision/recall curves. • Highlight best-performing model. • Include: "Class-agnostic detection outperforms class-wise in low-resolution setups." Show qualitative results: correct detections, failure cases, rotated-kiln detection. SECTION 7 – ABLATIONS & ANALYSIS: Show three mini-panels: • Effect of OBB vs AABB. • Effect of resolution and band combinations. • Cross-state generalization and domain shift. Use simple bar charts and maps. SECTION 8 – APPLICATIONS (SPACE → POLICY): A horizontal "Space-to-Policy" pipeline: Satellite imagery → Kiln detection model → District heatmap → Compliance monitoring dashboard. Add icons for alerts, GIS layers, pollution overlays. SECTION 9 – KEY CONTRIBUTIONS: Four bullet-style callout boxes: • Largest annotated kiln dataset at national scale. • High-quality OBB annotations. • Strong geographic generalization splits. • Standardized benchmark for satellite object detection. FOOTER: NeurIPS-style acknowledgment block with "Open-source dataset + code", GitHub icon, QR code placeholder. Design constraints: • Professional, minimal, data-first. • Use satellite imagery textures sparingly for hero visuals. • Emphasize clarity, not artistic distortion. • Keep the poster visually dense but clean, like a top-tier ML conference poster.",

      "prompt": "Create a full scientific poster titled "JoulesEye: Energy Expenditure and Respiration Sensing from Thermal Imagery While Exercising". Layout: a clean conference-style A1 poster with sections: Overview, Method, Sensing Pipeline, Modeling, Results, Key Findings. Top banner: Title + one wide photo-style illustration of participant cycling or running with an iPhone-mounted FLIR thermal camera, indirect calorimeter mask, and chest belt. Add icons. Section 1 – Problem: Short box describing energy expenditure (kcal/min) and why wearables using heart rate are inaccurate (error ~40%). Include small icon for indirect calorimeter. Section 2 – Thermal Respiration Sensing: Diagram of nostril ROI in thermal video, showing heating during exhalation and cooling during inhalation. Add inset waveform. Show RGB-based landmark detection → CSRT tracking → ROI intensity → respiration signal. Use simple arrows. Section 3 – Hardware: Show FLIR One Pro thermal camera + smartphone setup, smartwatch prototype with low-resolution thermal sensor (32×24), indirect calorimeter mask, chest belt. Section 4 – Data Collection: Timeline for two sessions: Session 1: thermal camera + chest belt (no mask) → ground truth RR comparison. Session 2: thermal camera + indirect calorimeter + chest belt → VO2 and EE ground truth. Include tiny HIIT protocol graphic (3-min high/low intensity blocks). Section 5 – Modeling: Two-stage TCN pipeline: (1) RR → Volume (v) (2) Volume → VO2 → Energy Expenditure (kcal/min) Show dilated causal conv blocks, residuals, arrows, and optional covariates (temperature, heart rate). Section 6 – Results: Place 3 key result blocks: (1) Respiration rate accuracy: 2.1% error vs chest belt. (2) EE estimation: 5.8% MAPE vs indirect calorimeter. (3) Comparison bar chart: Apple Watch EE error 37.5%, RR-based JoulesEye 5–6%, HR-based model 12%. Include cycling vs running examples. Section 7 – Low-Resolution Thermal: Small panel showing 160×120 thermal vs 32×24 pixelated thermal, with note: "Respiration still detectable; enables smartwatch integration." Section 8 – Contributions: • Robust respiration during motion (cycling, running) • TCN-based EE estimation • Low-res thermal feasibility • 54-participant study Visual Style: Modern scientific poster design, flat minimal graphics, blue–teal palette, high legibility, clean icons, clear hierarchy, thin lines, small equations, heatmaps, and waveforms. Layout should look like a NeurIPS/Ubicomp poster.",
